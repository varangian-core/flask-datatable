### Project Description

Simple implementation of a flask data table along with the bootstrap and jquery. Application is designed to provide a dynamic table with connectivity to other APIs. In this particular case, we are accessing a static file server to display the links.

_Notice: both the information pertaining to the database and the API static file server have been removed. You will need to adjust those parameters accordingly. While this project does utilize MySQL, due to the licensing requirements the user is encouraged to use MariaDB for production purposes.
